**File descriptions:**
https://github.com/willgraham345/pythonArduinoSerialPWMControl/tree/main/PWM_Writer4_pythonToArduino: Supports serial writing of 4 different PWM outputs from python to arduino
https://github.com/willgraham345/pythonArduinoSerialPWMControl/tree/main/PWM_Writer_pythonToArduino: Same as above file, but only writes to one PWM output. Ideal for building PWM force curve.
https://github.com/willgraham345/pythonArduinoSerialPWMControl/tree/main/hardwareTest_flatPWM: outputs a 100% duty cycle PWM wave, made for testing both the circuit and hardware

https://github.com/willgraham345/pythonArduinoSerialPWMControl/blob/main/Schematic.jpg: A schematic of the circuit. Hopefully it's self explanatory lol
